Project 3c, an assignment for ENGR 103 at Oregon State University. 

Write a program that prompts the user for an integer that the player
(maybe the user, maybe someone else) will try to guess. 
If the player's guess is higher than the target integer, 
the program should display too high. If the user's guess is
lower than the target integer, the program should display too low. 
The program should use a loop that repeats until the 
user correctly guesses the integer. 
Then the program should print how many guesses it took.
